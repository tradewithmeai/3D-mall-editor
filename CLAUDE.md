## üîÑ Current Session: Manual Room Build Protocol (2025-08-05)

**Git Tree Strategy:**
- `step-2-remove-add-cycle` branch: Contains session work with JSON fixes and factory simplification  
- `manual-room-build` branch: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** - Clean workspace for step-by-step manual construction
- **Rollback Protocol:** Use `git checkout step-2-remove-add-cycle` to restore session work if needed

**Essential Missing Stage Identified:** Manual construction with visual validation before factory automation

**Files Cleaned:**
- Removed: `component-manager.js`, `enhanced-components.json`, `test-component-catalog.html`, `test-logging-framework.html`
- Kept: `componentFactory.js` (simplified), `components.json` (flat), `room-layout.json` (will regenerate)

**Next:** Step-by-step room build with visual checks at each micro-step

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Future Validation Requirements

### Navigation/Collision Testing Gap
**Issue Identified:** Sanity Check G (Nav-mesh testing) uses raycasting but doesn't test actual character movement collision.
- **Current Test:** Raycasting from test points (incomplete validation)
- **Real Need:** Character movement around environment to verify walls actually block player
- **Status:** Too complex to implement during baseline validation phase
- **Action Required:** Must retest collision system once character movement is integrated back into factory system

**Critical Note:** The baseline JSON is structurally complete but movement collision validation is deferred until character integration phase.

## üéâ BASELINE VALIDATION COMPLETE (2025-08-05)

### ‚úÖ 100% RIGID BASELINE ACHIEVED
**Comprehensive Validation Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Scene Integrity Confirmed** - All 9 objects created and positioned correctly
- ‚úÖ **Schema Extended** - Spawn points and interaction zones added successfully  
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Load Testing** - Scene clear/rebuild cycle works perfectly
- ‚úÖ **JSON Round-Trip** - Complete metadata export/import capability confirmed
- ‚úÖ **World Bounds Calculated** - Proper dimensional boundaries established
- üèÜ **RIGIDITY SCORE: 100%** - All automated validation checks passed

**Validation Method:** Step-by-step manual build with automated assertions + visual confirmation at each phase

### ‚è≥ DEFERRED VALIDATION ITEMS
**Items requiring character movement integration:**
- **Real Collision Testing** - Wall boundaries need character controller to validate properly
- **Navigation Mesh Verification** - Player movement constraints testing
- **Interactive Zone Functionality** - Proximity triggers and debug grid toggle

**Test Improvement Needs:**
- **Slow Motion Demos** - Add delays for visual confirmation of fast operations
- **Before/After Snapshots** - Capture state changes for better validation
- **Progress Indicators** - Visual feedback for operations that happen instantly

### üöÄ READY FOR NEXT PHASE: AI AGENT INTEGRATION
**Foundation Status:** Rock-solid JSON-driven 3D environment ready for:
- Factory-based room creation via AI agents
- Character movement and collision system integration  
- Diana AI natural language commands
- Multi-room expansion and navigation

**Baseline Tag:** `v1.0-RoomBlueprint` - Complete validated room construction system
