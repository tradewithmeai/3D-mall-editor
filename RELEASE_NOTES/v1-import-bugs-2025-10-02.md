# 3D Simulator v1-import Working Snapshot (2025-10-02)

This snapshot introduces working scene.3d.v1 import functionality to the 3D simulator, including a visible Import button, drag-and-drop support, ghost grid visualization (60×40), and automatic scene loading. The simulator auto-loads `/scenes/active.scene.3d.v1.json` on startup (8×3 test scene with 24 floor tiles), falls back gracefully to legacy format if v1 files are unavailable, and provides proper console logging with `[SCENE:v1]` format showing tiles/edges/bounds information. **How to run**: Open `index.html` in a browser with HTTP server (no file:// protocol), use the "Import Scene (.scene.3d.v1.json)" button in the top-right toolbar, or drag-and-drop .json files directly onto the 3D canvas. **Known bugs**: Some coordinate mapping issues may exist, camera positioning might need adjustment for different scene sizes, and the ghost grid may not align perfectly with all imported content - this is a working-but-buggy milestone for further development.
