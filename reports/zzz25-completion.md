# zzz25 Completion Report

## Summary
Created and locked 2D→3D Interface Contract v1 as a single source-of-truth specification mapping scene.v1 (2D) to 3D construction API. Consolidated zzz24a/24b drafts into a definitive contract with field-by-field conversions, worked examples, validation checklist, and e2e fixture. Contract ready for implementation across both 3d-mall-editor and 3d-mall-template repositories.

## Repo State
- **HEAD SHA**: 0871acd4fd807da2939026fdf5437a24971a4245
- **Branch**: main
- **Repository**: 3d-mall-editor

## Acceptance Criteria

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC1 | ✅ | Interface file created at reports/2d→3d-interface-v1.md with version header "Interface Contract v1" - ready for identical commit to both repos |
| AC2 | ✅ | Filename rule: `<safeId>.scene.3d.v1.json` and axis mapping: `2D(x,y) → 3D(x,z) with Y-up` stated in Quick Reference section |
| AC3 | ✅ | Worked example converts 2×2 floor + walls into complete 3D API calls with coordinates: createFloor(), createWall(), setBounds() |
| AC4 | ✅ | E2E fixture "unit-1×1-with-wall-gap" described with input JSON and expected 3D output specifications |
| AC5 | ✅ | No contradictions with zzz24a audit - all constants, coordinates, and transforms consistent with source analysis |

## Key Contract Specifications

### Core Transforms
- **Unit Conversion**: `worldUnit = cellSize × 0.05` (20px → 1.0m)
- **Coordinate Mapping**: `2D(x,y) → 3D(x,z)` with Y-up axis
- **Export Filename**: `<safeId>.scene.3d.v1.json` pattern

### 3D Object Defaults
- **Floor Tiles**: 1m×1m×0.1m at grid centers
- **Wall Height**: 3.0 meters standard
- **Wall Thickness**: 0.2 meters
- **Door Placeholder**: Skip walls where `edge.type === 'door'`

### Implementation Ready
- Complete field-by-field mapping table
- Worked example with 8 3D API calls
- Validation checklist with 20 verification points
- E2E fixture for integration testing

## Next Steps
1. Commit identical contract to 3d-mall-template repository
2. Implementation teams can begin 3D rendering development
3. No ambiguity remains - all conversions precisely specified

## Files Created
