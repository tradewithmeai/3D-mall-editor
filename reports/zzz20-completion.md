# zzz20 Completion Report

## Summary
Implemented export-time warnings for enclosure and bounds validation. Added minimal rules to make 2D→3D safe without blocking workflow - warns (doesn't block) when floors aren't enclosed by walls and when content lies outside parent bounds. Created unified warning modal system that integrates with all export handlers while maintaining existing download paths and schema formats.

## Repo State
- **Branch**: main
- **HEAD SHA**: 98e100ebbbf539ac2faeb0ffcfbe29ade083ee11

## Acceptance Criteria

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC1 | ✅ | Missing perimeter walls produce specific side warnings - SceneRules.checkUnenclosedFloors() generates warnings like `(x,y)[N\|S\|E\|W]` for missing wall sides |
| AC2 | ✅ | Out-of-bounds placements trigger warnings with counts - SceneRules.checkOutOfBoundsContent() reports `X tiles, Y edges` with example coordinates |
| AC3 | ✅ | "Export anyway" downloads with proper logging - exportWithWarnings() shows modal, logs `[EXPORT] {warnings:n}` and `[DOWNLOAD] {filename}` |
| AC4 | ✅ | No schema changes - ExportBuilder.js still uses `*.v1` schemas and version `"1.0"` throughout |
| AC5 | ✅ | No runtime meta.schema reads introduced - SceneRules.js contains zero references to `meta.schema` |
| AC6 | ✅ | One shared download path confirmed - only one `downloadJSON()` call exists, inside `exportWithWarnings()` method |

## Console Logs for [BOUNDS]

### Export Logging
```javascript
// Before export - warning collection
console.info('[EXPORT]', { type: 'gallery-template', warnings: 2 });

// After successful export
console.info('[DOWNLOAD]', { filename: 'gallery-123.unit-template.v1.json' });
```

### Warning Examples
```javascript
// Rule A: Unenclosed floors
"Unenclosed floors: (2,3)[N|E], (4,5)[S] and 3 more - missing perimeter walls"

// Rule B: Out-of-bounds content
"Out-of-bounds content: 5 tiles, 3 edges - tile(10,15), vedge(12,8) and 4 more"
```

## Implementation Step Notes

### Step 1: SceneRules.js Module
- Created `src/editor/core/SceneRules.js` with `collectWarnings()` static method
- Rule A: `checkUnenclosedFloors()` - validates floor tiles have walls on non-floor adjacent sides
- Rule B: `checkOutOfBoundsContent()` - validates tiles/edges are within active bounds
- Returns array of human-readable warning messages with coordinates

### Step 2: Warning Modal System
- Added `showWarningModal()` method with styled overlay and modal
- Lists all warnings with "Cancel" and "Export Anyway" buttons
- Promise-based user decision handling
- Responsive design with proper z-index layering

### Step 3: Export Integration
- Created `exportWithWarnings()` method as unified export handler
- Integrates warning collection, modal display, and download
- Added proper `[EXPORT]` and `[DOWNLOAD]` console logging
- Replaced all `downloadJSON()` calls with `exportWithWarnings()` calls

### Step 4: Unified Download Path
- Verified single download mechanism through `downloadJSON()`
- All export types (mall, gallery, room, object, scene) use same warning flow
- Maintained existing filename patterns and schema formats
- No changes to export data structures or file formats

## Files Changed
- **src/editor/core/SceneRules.js** - New validation rules module
- **src/editor/editor.js** - Warning modal integration, export logging, unified download path

## Known Issues/Deferrals
None. Implementation is complete and maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing export functionality unchanged
- Schema formats and versions preserved
- No blocking validation - warnings are informational only
- Modal can be dismissed to proceed with export
- All file naming conventions maintained

## Testing Verification
- **Rule A**: Floor tiles without perimeter walls generate specific coordinate warnings
- **Rule B**: Content outside template bounds generates count and coordinate warnings
- **Export Flow**: Warning modal appears before download when issues detected
- **Logging**: Console shows [EXPORT] with warning count and [DOWNLOAD] with filename
- **Schema Preservation**: All exports maintain original *.v1 schema and version "1.0"
- **Unified Path**: Single downloadJSON() method handles all export types
