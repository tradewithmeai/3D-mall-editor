# zzz19 Completion Report

## Summary
Implemented drag-rectangle floor tool and two-point wall segment tool as requested. Added new toolbar buttons with stable IDs (tool-drag-rect, tool-wall-segment), implemented comprehensive mouse event handling system supporting multi-step tool interactions, integrated bounds checking with existing template system, and added preview rendering for visual feedback during tool usage.

## Repo State
- **Branch**: main
- **HEAD SHA**: 517fddc45dc82b9e78441d9be287c2095ec09bfc

## Acceptance Criteria

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC1 | ✅ | Added `<button id="tool-drag-rect" class="tool-btn" data-tool="dragRect">Rect</button>` and `<button id="tool-wall-segment" class="tool-btn" data-tool="wallSegment">Wall</button>` to index.html:19-20 |
| AC2 | ✅ | Implemented `handleMouseDown()`, `handleMouseMove()`, `handleMouseUp()` with tool-specific state management for dragRect tool |
| AC3 | ✅ | Floor placement uses `completeDragRect()` with bounds checking via `isWithinTemplateBounds()` and `setCell(x, y, 'floor')` |
| AC4 | ✅ | Wall segment tool implements two-click system with `wallSegmentStart` state and `completeWallSegment()` method |
| AC5 | ✅ | Diagonal wall rejection: `if (Math.abs(endX - startX) !== 0 && Math.abs(endY - startY) !== 0) return;` |
| AC6 | ✅ | Both tools integrate with `isWithinTemplateBounds(x, y)` before placement operations |
| AC7 | ✅ | Preview rendering system: `renderDragRectPreview()` and `renderWallSegmentPreview()` with visual feedback |
| AC8 | ✅ | No schema changes - tools work with existing grid system and template boundaries |

## Console Logs for [BOUNDS]
```javascript
// Drag-rectangle floor tool bounds checking
console.log('[BOUNDS] dragRect bounds check:', {
    startX, startY, endX, endY,
    withinBounds: this.isWithinTemplateBounds(x, y)
});

// Wall-segment tool bounds checking
console.log('[BOUNDS] wallSegment bounds check:', {
    startX, startY, endX, endY,
    withinBounds: this.isWithinTemplateBounds(x, y)
});
```

## Implementation Step Notes

### Step 1: HTML Button Addition
- Added two new toolbar buttons with exact IDs as specified
- Used consistent styling with existing tool buttons
- Integrated with existing tool-btn class and data-tool attributes

### Step 2: Mouse Event System Overhaul
- Replaced single `handleMouseAction()` with three-method system:
  - `handleMouseDown(e)` - Initiates tool interactions
  - `handleMouseMove(e)` - Updates previews and tracking
  - `handleMouseUp(e)` - Completes operations
- Added state tracking: `dragRectStart`, `wallSegmentStart`, `currentMouseGrid`

### Step 3: Tool Implementation
- **Drag-Rectangle Floor**: Click-drag to place rectangular floor areas
- **Wall-Segment**: Click two points to place straight walls (rejects diagonals)
- Both tools respect template boundaries and show previews

### Step 4: Preview System
- `renderToolPreviews()` called during mouse movement
- Visual feedback shows intended placement before completion
- Previews clear automatically on tool completion or cancellation

## Files Changed
- **src/editor/index.html** - Added tool-drag-rect and tool-wall-segment buttons
- **src/editor/editor.js** - Complete mouse event system overhaul, new tool implementations, preview rendering
- **reports/zzz19-completion.md** - This completion report

## Known Issues/Deferrals
None. Both tools work as specified with proper bounds checking, preview feedback, and integration with existing template system. Editor loads successfully and tools are immediately usable from the toolbar.

## Testing Verification
- Editor loads without JavaScript errors at http://127.0.0.1:5173/src/editor/index.html
- Both new tool buttons appear in toolbar and activate correctly
- Drag-rectangle tool places floor tiles within bounds
- Wall-segment tool places straight walls with diagonal rejection
- Preview rendering provides visual feedback during tool usage
- Bounds checking prevents placement outside template areas
